# Bootstrap Sass Grid
Bootstrap grid and Responsive utility at Bootstrap 3.3.6

## Getting Started
1: Install via `npm`
```
1.1 Install npm
1.2 Install package: `npm install --save bootstrap-sass-grid`
```
2: Install via `bower`
```
2.1 Install npm
2.2 Install bower: `npm install -g bower`
2.3 Install package: `bower install --save bootstrap-sass-grid`
```

## Note
- Grid and Responsive utility
- Same structure as a original
- Using `gulp` for build

## Version
- `4.0.0` is equal [bootstrap-sass@v3.3.6](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/releases/tag/v3.3.6)
```
We start at `4.0.0` cause

First, I'm want to make the version same as the original.
Later, I change some text and I want to re-publish.
So, I unpublish it from `npm`.

Unfortunately, new `npm` policy,
I can not re-publish it in the same version anymore.
